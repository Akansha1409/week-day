# Weekday Data Transformation

## 📌 Overview
This project transforms a dictionary of date-value pairs into a dictionary keyed by weekdays (Mon–Sun) with summed values.  
If a weekday is missing in the input, its value is calculated as the **average of the nearest previous and next available days**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 📅 Converts `YYYY-MM-DD` date keys into weekday names (`Mon`, `Tue`, ...).
- ➕ Aggregates multiple dates falling on the same weekday.
- 🔄 Automatically fills missing weekdays with the average of the closest available days.
- ✅ Fully tested with **Jest**.
